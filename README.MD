Hello this repo will be for practicing reviewing and improving my python skills.

I plan to do the initial challenge based on the free "Daily python Projects" which you can subscribe at [here](https://dailypythonprojects.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=email-subscribe&r=4myrtf&next=https%3A%2F%2Fdailypythonprojects.substack.com%2Fp%2Fsimple-dice-rolling-simulator&utm_medium=email)

but ideally I would solve initial challenge and then move on to leveling it up in some way!

Each folder should have a main.py, elevated.py and a .md or .txt file highlighting any new tools or techniques I learned while doing either the challenge or elevated challenge. To help with learning, and call back if I need to use them again in the future!
