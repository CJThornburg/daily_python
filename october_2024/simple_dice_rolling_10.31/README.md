- ## tl:dr challenge
  - print 6 sided dice roll outcome



  - ### Main
    - Refresher
      - using random library
    - Learned
      - This is half learned / half refresher as I learned this fairly recently
        - `"\n"` or `'\n'` can be used to provide line breaks


  - ### Elevated
    - Input will ask for how many dice and number of sides facing dice. (Standard)
      - D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20
    - Refresher on while loops
    - input correct/incorrect patterns
    - REFRESHER on for loops on dict in python
      - syntax


  - ### Random Thoughts
    - damn python fast, well compared to js
